Use the Excel spreadsheet to decode the hex transmission

This is an example of a transmitted message:
    S000C042900CA7R0T13112D
Once separated into the three sections, with the help of the header code it looks like this:
    S 000C042900CA7
    R 0
    T 13112D
Once separated into the different integer representations it looks like this:
    S 000C  0429  00CA  7
    R 0
    T 131  12D
